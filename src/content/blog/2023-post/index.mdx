## 

Token locking refers to the practice of restricting access to a certain amount of a cryptocurrency's tokens for a specific period.
The dev locked his tokens for three months! The whales locked for one month, and artist that create memes on demand!
Locking tokens can create artificial scarcity, that in turn can increase the perceived value of the remaining circulating coins.
Meme coins are notoriously volatile and often driven by hype. Therefore, any mechanism that can increase stability and trust is highly valued.
