Streamflow is a platform that facilitates the locking of cryptocurrency tokens. This means that project developers can use Streamflow to place their own tokens into a smart contract, which restricts their ability to sell or move those tokens for a predetermined period.
This is done to alleviate concerns about "rug pulls," where developers suddenly sell off their tokens, causing the coin's value to collapse.
